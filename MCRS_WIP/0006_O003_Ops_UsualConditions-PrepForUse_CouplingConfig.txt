							<trim.para>During coupling to the prime mover, it may be required to adjust the angle of the main frame to accommodate the height of the fifth wheel plate. Do this to ensure when coupling that the transport legs and bottom breather valve do not make contact with the after frame of the prime mover as it backs into position. Failure to comply could cause the FWTRD to shift and may cause injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Never stand between the prime mover and FWTRD when the prime mover is backed under the towing device. A crush hazard exists. Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Coupling should be done by two people, the first person in the prime mover cab and the second acting as a ground guide. The person in the prime mover cab must keep the ground guide in sight at all times. All other personnel should stand completely clear of the area. A crush hazard exists. Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Hydraulic pressure from the prime mover can reach 3000 psi (20 684 kPa) when using wet lines. Never connect or disconnect hydraulic wet lines without ensuring that the prime mover Power Take Off is disengaged and engine of the prime mover is off. Should lines be disconnected with the PTO engaged, over pressurizing the system could cause lines or fittings to burst and hydraulic oil to spill creating a slip hazard. Failure to comply could result in damage to equipment and serious injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Be sure to wear the proper eye protection (safety glasses) when working on or near hydraulic systems to avoid personal injury or death. The ground guide should be kept in sight at all times to prevent injury to personnel.</trim.para>

						<note>
							<trim.para>Once connected to wet lines, the operator can use the FWTRD without having to utilize the electric control box, specifically having to depress the electric motor switch. The second control box switch is moved from "electric" to "wet line" so that if the remote control is utilized during wet line operation the FWTRD electric motors do not engage. This maintains proper hydraulic fluid levels between the FWTRD and the Prime Mover hydraulic systems.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Should the Prime Mover PTO system become inoperable requiring the FWTRD to be operated in "Electric" mode, the wet line hoses between the prime mover and the FWTRD should be properly disconnected (see Hydraulic Pressure Warning above). Failure to disconnect the wet lines prior to electric operation may result in the FWTRDï¿½s self-contained hydraulic supply being depleted over time, requiring PMCS to reset the proper FWTRD hydraulic levels.</trim.para>

							<trim.para>Wet line hydraulics should always be attached to and detached from the FWTRD with the FWTRD in the same configuration.
