							<trim.para>All personnel must stand clear at a distance twice the length of cable during winching operations. A snapped cable or shifting load could strike personnel causing injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Winch cables can become frayed or contain broken wires. Wear heavy leather-palmed work gloves when handling winch cables. Frayed or broken wire can injure hands. Never let winch cables slide through hands, even when wearing gloves. A broken wire could cut through glove and cut hand.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Refer to <extref docno="FM 4-30.31"/> for inspection of winch cable. A damaged winch cable, under load, could fail suddenly and strike personnel, and could cause the vehicle being recovered to shift suddenly creating a crush hazard. Failure to comply can result in injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
						</warning>
						<note>
							<trim.para>Refer to the proper TM for the prime mover as well as FM 4-30.31, �Recovery and Battle Damage Assessment and Repair� in conjunction with these instructions for additional information relating to rigging, winching and recovery.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Boom Extensions must be fully retracted when installing Boom Caps. The wing bolts used to stow the boom caps should be replaced in fifth wheel section for safe keeping.</trim.para>
