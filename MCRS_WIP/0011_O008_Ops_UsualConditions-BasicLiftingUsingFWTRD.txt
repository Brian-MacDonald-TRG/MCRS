							<trim.para>The following methods are for lifting a stationary object in preparation for towing or recovery only. Never attempt to tow any vehicle in these configurations. A crush hazard exists. Loads could shift suddenly if towing in this configuration were attempted. Failure to comply can result in damage to equipment and serious injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>The "Boom Retract" function of the FWTRD is protected by a 2000 psi limiter. This is to protect the boom cylinders from damage when performing lift tow operations. When utilizing the FWTRD for basic lifting, be aware that the amount of weight to be lifted will ultimately be determined by the boom retract limiter and should not exceed 10,000 lbs. Exceeding these limits could cause a load to shift or the booms to stop suddenly and create a crush hazard. Failure to comply may result in injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>These instructions assume that the operator(s) are trained for recovery operations and use of the FWTRD/TDRT and have an understanding of the different rigging configurations for performing recovery and lift tow operations as described in FM 4-30.31 Battle Damage Assessment and Recovery and FM 5-125 Rigging Techniques. Failure to comply may result in injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>These configurations are approved for the XM20 FWTRD with the M983 LET. Using any other prime mover to perform these lifts has not been tested at the time of writing this TM and could result in unstable conditions including shifting loads and crush hazards. Failure to comply could result in injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Wheels on the towed vehicle should be chocked and parking brakes engaged prior to performing pre-picking. Failure to comply could result in the vehicle moving unexpectedly creating a crush hazard causing serious injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
