							<trim.para>Jack must be positioned directly under axle to prevent slippage. Direct all personnel to stay clear of vehicle when vehicle is supported in the air. Failure to do so could result in serious injury or death to personnel and damage to the equipment.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>To prevent shifting of the trailer, the jack should be positioned on a hard level surface. Use support blocking as needed. Failure to comply could result in injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>The TDRT spare tire and wheel weigh approximately 200 lbs. (91kg). This requires use of the FWTRD 35K winch to help remove the tire from its holder or replace it on the holder. If the 35K winch is not available, two people must be used to remove or replace the spare. Failure to comply could result in injury to personnel.</trim.para>
						</warning>
						<note>
							<trim.para>Wheel replacement as described here is an �in the field� Operator task. The 12 ton jack is supported on the blocking from the BII. Place one of the 3-ply belting pieces between the jack and the support blocking to help prevent slippage of the jack.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>There are twelve tire and wheel assemblies and they are removed and installed the same way. This procedure covers one wheel assembly.</trim.para>

					<para>Using plastic blocking as needed from the FWTRD/TDRT BII to create a solid platform, position a piece of 3-ply belting and then the jack under the axle closest to where the wheel(s) will be removed, as shown. Note: The belting helps keep the jack from slipping on the plastic blocking.</para>

					<para>Using the FWTRD Remote or the valve control levers, use the 35K winch to lift and then support the spare tire as it is removed from its holder. Maneuver the tire to the side needed and using the winch, bring it to the ground. Note: If the tire is being brought to the driver side of the TDRT, removing the air lines and lighting cord will make maneuvering the wheel assembly easier.</para>
