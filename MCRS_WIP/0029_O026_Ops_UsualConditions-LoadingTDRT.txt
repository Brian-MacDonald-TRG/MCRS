							<trim.para>All persons not involved in the loading or unloading operation must stand clear the full length of prime mover and Tilt Deck Recovery Trailer (TDRT). A crush hazard exists.  Failure to comply may result in injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Due to the center of gravity of some loads, Caution must be used when loading or unloading equipment to prevent shifting loads. Always use proper rigging as specified in FM 5-125 "Rigging Techniques, Procedures, and Applications". Shifting loads can create a crush hazard that could cause injury or death to personnel and/or damage to equipment.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Visibility from the prime mover is significantly reduced when backing, whether the TDRT is loaded or not. If backing the TDRT is required, it should be done by two people, the first person in the prime mover cab and the second acting as a ground guide. The person in the prime mover cab must keep the ground guide in sight at all times. All other personnel should stand completely clear of the area. A crush hazard exists. Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Use low speeds (5mph or less) when loading or unloading vehicles. Higher speeds will exaggerate motions and create hazardous conditions, which could result in personal injury.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>The TDRT axles are locked into place with an air operated locating pin. The pin is locked in the travel position and released to slide axles forward for loading. There is also a pin locating hole in the forward axle position. This position would only be utilized in an exceptional situation where a very tight turn needs to be negotiated. The pin could be locked forward for the purpose of negotiating the turn, but must immediately be returned to the rearward transport position. The pin must ALWAYS be locked before transporting a load on the TDRT. Failure to comply could cause the axles to move unexpectedly during transport resulting in unstable loads, damage to the axles, and possible loss of control of the prime mover resulting in serious injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>The landing legs for the TDRT are each retracted manually. They weigh 121lbs (54.88Kg) each. They are spring assisted, but caution should be used when lifting and/or setting these components into position. Failure to comply may result in injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>The tail sections of the Tilt Deck Recovery Trailer weigh 175lbs each (79.38Kg). Two people should be used to unfold the ramp sections.  Caution should be exercised when handling these components. Failure to comply may result in injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Winching components that are used in loading the TDRT can weigh up to 105lbs (47.63Kg). Use an assistant when removing and handling heavy items to prevent injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>The prime mover winch may be utilized when loading the Tilt Deck Recovery Trailer. All personnel must stand clear at minimum the length of the cable during winching operations. A snapped cable or shifting load could strike personnel and cause injury or death.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Ensure cable has a minimum of five wraps of cable on the drum before operating reel. Failure to comply may result in injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Winch cables can become frayed or contain broken wires. Wear heavy leather-palmed work gloves when handling winch cables. Frayed or broken wire can injure hands. Never let a winch cable slide through hands, even when wearing gloves. A broken wire could cut through glove and cut hand.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Refer to <extref docno="FM 5-125"/> for inspection of winch cables. A damaged winch cable, under load, could fail suddenly and strike personnel, and could cause the vehicle being recovered to shift suddenly creating a crush hazard. Failure to comply can result in injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>The center surface of the TDRT deck is prepared for walking up when in the tilted position. Cautions should be exercised when walking up any other area of the TDRT deck when in the tilted position.  Failure to comply may result in slipping and may cause injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
