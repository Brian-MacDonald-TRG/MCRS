							<trim.para>Because the TDRT is coupled to the FWTRD for operation, all cold weather instructions regarding operation of the FWTRD must be followed for the TDRT to operate properly. Consult WP <xref wpid="O00001-9-2320-451"/> of the FWTRD TM for cold weather instructions regarding the FWTRD. Failure to comply may result in damage to the equipment.</trim.para>
