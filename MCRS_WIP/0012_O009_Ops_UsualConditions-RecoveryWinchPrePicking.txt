							<trim.para>The following methods are for lifting a stationary object in preparation for towing or recovery only. Never attempt to tow any vehicle in these configurations. A crush hazard exists. Loads could shift suddenly if towing in this configuration were attempted. Failure to comply can result in and serious injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>These instructions assume that the operator(s) are trained for Recovery Operations and use of the FWTRD/TDRT. Then operator has an understanding of the different rigging configurations for performing recovery and lift tow operations as described in FM 4-30.31 Battle Damage Assessment and Recovery and FM 5-125 Rigging Techniques. Failure to comply may result in injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>These configurations are approved for the XM20 Fifth Wheel Towing and Recovery Device with the M983 LET. Using any other prime mover to perform these lifts has not been tested. Failure to comply could result in injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Wheels on the towed vehicle should be chocked and parking brakes engaged prior to performing pre-picking. Failure to comply could result in the vehicle moving unexpectedly creating a crush hazard causing serious injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>

Removal of the cross bar for sledding from its storage bracket is described in WP <xref wpid="O00008-9-2320-451"/>, and should be performed prior to beginning this task.</trim.para>
