			<title>CORROSION PREVENTION AND CONTROL (CPC)</title>
			<para>Corrosion prevention and control of Army materiel is a continuing concern. It is important that any corrosion problems with this item be reported so that the problem can be corrected and improvements can be made to prevent the problem in future items. The term "corrosion" means the deterioration of a material or its properties due to a reaction of that material with its chemical environment. An example is the rusting of iron. Corrosion damage in metals can be seen, depending on the metal, as tarnishing, pitting, fogging, surface residue, and/or cracking. Plastics, composites, and rubbers can also degrade (also considered to be corrosion based on the above definition of corrosion). Degradation is caused by thermal (heat), oxidation (oxygen), solvation (solvents), or photolytic (light, typically ultraviolet) processes. The most common exposures are excessive heat or light. Damage from these processes will appear as cracking, softening, swelling, and/or breaking. The US Army has defined the following nine (9) forms of corrosion used to evaluate the deterioration of metals. These shall be used when evaluating and documenting corrosion.
				<randlist bullet="no">
					<item>UNIFORM (or general attack): Affects a large area of exposed metal surface, like rust on steel or tarnish on silver. It gradually reduces the thickness of the metal until it fails.</item>
					<item>CREVICE: Occurs in crevices created by rubber seals, gaskets, bolt heads, lap joints, dirt or other surface deposits. It will develop anywhere moisture or other corrosive agents are trapped and unable to drain or evaporate.</item>
					<item>SELECTIVE LEACHING: One element, usually the anodic element of an alloy, corrodes away, leaving the cathodic element. This can create holes in metal.</item>
					<item>INTERGRANULAR: Metal deterioration caused by corrosion on the bonds between or across the grain boundaries of the metal. The metal will appear to be peeling off in sheets, flaking, or being pushed apart by layers. A particular type of intergranular corrosion is exfoliation.</item>
					<item>PITTING: This can result from conditions similar to those for crevice corrosion. Pits can develop on various materials due to their composition. Rifle boxes are big victims of pitting.</item>
					<item>EROSION: Results when a moving fluid (liquid or gas) flows across a metal surface, particularly when solid particles are present in the fluid. Corrosion actually occurs on the surface of the metal, but the moving fluid washes away the corrosion and exposes a new metal surface, which also corrodes.</item>
					<item>FRETTING: Occurs as a result of small, repetitive movements (e.g., vibration) between two surfaces in contact with each other.It's usually identified by a black powder corrosion product or pits on the surface.</item>
					<item>GALVANIC: Occurs when two different types of metal come in contact with each other, like steel bolts on aluminum, for example. This is a common problem on aircraft because of their mix of metals.</item>
					<item>STRESS: Term used to describe corrosion cracking and corrosion fatigue. Where an item is not ready/available due to one of these forms of corrosion, it shall be recorded as a corrosion failure in the inspection record and the appropriate code (170) for corrosion shall be used when requesting/performing maintenance.</item>

					The Modular Catastrophic Recovery System (MCRS) is a multi-component recovery system consisting of a Fifth Wheel Towing and Recovery Device (FWTRD) which engages into the Tilt Deck Recovery Trailer (TDRT). The MCRS imposes a downward load on the prime mover at the fifth wheel, thus towed weight is evenly distributed on all axles of the prime mover. The operator maintains safe steering and braking of the prime mover and the vehicle in tow. Because the load pivots at the fifth wheel, turning ability and off-road mobility are significantly increased.

					The FWTRD can be utilized independently of the TDRT to lift tow a full complement of wheeled vehicles and is equipped with a dedicated 35K winch and boom caps to provide a stable platform for recovery winching. The prime mover&rsquo;s heavy duty 45K winch can also be utilized, alone or with the FWTRD, for straight pulls <callout assocfig="G00002-9-2320-451-F0002" label="1"/>. The 35K winch also allows for recovery of vehicles at 90 degrees to the prime mover <callout assocfig="G00002-9-2320-451-F0002" label="2"/>.

				<para>The Modular Catastrophic Recovery System (MCRS) is a heavy duty under lift towing and recovery device that is utilized for the recovery and transportation of vehicles. The MCRS consists of two major components; the Fifth Wheel Towing and Recovery Device (FWTRD) and the Tilt Deck Recovery Trailer (TDRT). The FWTRD is capable of completing multiple procedures contingent upon the status of the vehicle that needs evacuation. The TDRT is utilized in conjunction with the FWTRD, to transport recovered vehicles that the FWTRD is unable to tow due to excess weight, unserviceable axles, or destroyed due to battle.</para>
				<para>Procedures performed by the FWTRD consist of winch recovery, pre-picking, lift towing, loading, and transportation of the TDRT. The hydraulic control valve levers are located aft of the fifth wheel connection and forward of the MAST section of the FWTRD. The control valve levers activate hydraulic pistons to extend or retract. If the BOOM lever is pressed down, the pistons extend and the angle between the BOOM and the MAST (the boom angle) is increased. If the BOOM valve lever is pushed up, the pistons retract and the boom angle is decreased.</para>
				<para>The MAST and the BOOM levers, under normal system operation, lifts the asset to be towed, by attaching the FWTRD&rsquo;s booms to the towed asset and then hydraulically extending the BOOM&rsquo;s and mast cylinders to raise the load. This allows the fifth wheel device to lift the vehicle being towed to the desired height while maintaining a level fifth wheel. These raising and lowering effects occur because of the pivoting motion of the FWTRD. Locking and checking fifth wheel coupling connection after connecting if recommended to ensure fifth wheel pivot is secure.</para>
				<para>The Tilt Deck Recovery Trailer (TDRT) is self-supporting when detached from the FWTRD due to its landing legs. The legs are manually positioned and pinned as needed for operation. No crane or lifting device is required during attachment or detachment. The TDRT gives the operator the ability to trailer transport vehicles that are inoperable or battle damaged. The TDRT engages the FWTRD which serves as the fifth wheel connection. The TDRT features a three axle (one of which is an air lift axle) sliding carriage that when slid forward, allows the TDRT deck to tilt to the rear for loading. This allows the operator to set up for loading without having to disengage from the FWTRD. After damaged vehicle is loaded onto the TDRT, a sliding axle locking pin is engaged. The axle sliding locking pin is a safety feature which ensures the sliding axles are locked during transport. The TDRT also features drawer style &ldquo;pull-outs&rdquo; that allow the TDRT deck to expand from 102 in to 114 in. This allows the TDRT to accommodate varied wheelbase configurations. Load capacity of the TDRT is 70,000 lb.</para>

					<title>Electrical System</title>
				<para>The FWTRD is primarily a 12 Volt system that places an additional battery in series when using a 24 Volt NATO connection from a prime mover. A 12/24 Volt Junction Box allows for input from the prime mover of 12 or 24 volt to maintain the FWTRD batteries.</para>
				<para>There are two batteries, the Primary and Isolated, in a self-righting tray. They are charged through the 12/24 Volt Box Receptacles. The Primary Battery supplies the Electric Control Box and the Primary Motor/Solenoid with power. The Isolated Battery supplies the Isolated Motor/Solenoid with power and allows for a 24 Volt (series vs. parallel) connection from the prime mover by placing the lever of the 12/24 Junction Box in the 24V position.</para>
				 <para>The Electric Control Box distributes power (12V supplied from Primary Battery) to various components on the FWTRD including the following: Main power On/Off, the Motors/Solenoids (By depressing the electric motor button), the Remote Control- Valve Solenoids, the Work Light and the Strobe Lights.</para>
				 <para>The Motors and Solenoids control hydraulics for the FWTRD when operating in the "Electric" mode. When the FWTRD is switched to "Wet Line" mode the motors and solenoids are not needed and do not operate when a lever is pulled. The FWTRD can operate on only one Motor and Solenoid if one fails due to a jumper wire that joins the two solenoids.

				<para>The FWTRD can be operated by a self-contained electric-hydraulic system or by connecting the FWTRD to the PTO System of the Prime Mover. The system operates at pressures up to 3000 psi. Some functions are pressure limited by design and do not require operator input.

				Adjustable Hydraulic Flow Valves for both the Mast and Boom Functions allow for smooth operation of the FWTRD regardless of whether it is being operated in ELECTRIC or WET LINE mode.
