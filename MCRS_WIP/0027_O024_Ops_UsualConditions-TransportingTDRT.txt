							<trim.para>Ensure that the Tilt Deck Recovery Trailer has been properly configured for travel prior to moving. The trailer must be properly secured to a Fifth Wheel Towing and Recovery Device and the sliding axles in travel position and properly pinned. All air lines and electrical connections must be properly secured. If not properly secured the TDRT could separate from the FWTRD. Failure to comply can result in injury or death to personnel and damage to the equipment.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>If backing the TDRT is required, it should be done by two people. The first person in the prime mover cab, and the second acting as a ground guide. The person in the prime mover cab must keep the ground guide in sight at all times. All other personnel should stand completely clear of the area. A crush hazard exists. Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
