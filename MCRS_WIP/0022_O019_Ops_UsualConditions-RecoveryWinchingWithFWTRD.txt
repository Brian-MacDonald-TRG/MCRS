							<trim.para>All personnel must stand clear at a distance twice the length of cable during winching operations. A snapped winch cable or shifting load could strike personnel causing injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Unless a specific winch is indicated for a particular procedure, these instructions can be performed with the prime mover 45K winch or the FWTRD 35K winch. The operator should make the proper assessment of the situation in accordance with FM 4-30.31, Recovery and Battle Damage Assessment and Repair in order to determine the proper winch needed for the recovery. Failure to comply may cause injury or death to personnel and or damage to the equipment.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>The procedures outlined in this chapter refer to using heavy duty winches (45K or 35K) in conjunction with the FWTRD. The 45K and 35K winches are the primary recovery winches. The 18K winch on the FWTRD has limited capacity and should not be used for recovery of vehicles. Failure to comply may cause injury or death to personnel and or damage to the equipment.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Winch cable can become frayed or contain broken wires. Wear heavy leather-palmed work gloves when handling winch cable. Frayed or broken wire can injure hands. Never let a winch cable slide through hands, even when wearing gloves. A broken wire could cut through glove and cut hand. Refer to FM 5-125 for inspection of winch cables. A damaged winch cable, under load, could fail suddenly and strike personnel, and could cause the vehicle being recovered to shift suddenly creating a crush hazard. Failure to comply can result in injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>

							<trim.para>Assess the situation using "R.E.C.O.V.E.R.Y." method as described in <extref docno="FM 4-30.31"/> section 4-14. This will determine whether you are using the 45K or 35K winch with the FWTRD, and the mechanical advantage (MA) needed to complete the recovery (single, two-part line, etc.).</trim.para>

							<trim.para>Do not exceed 2000 psi hydraulic pressure when positioning the boom or mast for recovery winching operations. The terrain can vary from muddy to hard pack making specific boom and mast positions difficult to dictate. Limiting hydraulic pressure to 2000 psi prevents damage to the equipment or injury to personnel from bursting lines.</trim.para>
