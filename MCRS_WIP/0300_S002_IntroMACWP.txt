<title> The Army Maintenance System MAC </title>
<para> This introduction provides a general
explanation of the maintenance 								and
repair functions.  							</para>
<para> The MAC (immediately following this
introduction) designates 								overall authority
and responsibility for the performance of
maintenance 								tasks on the identified
end item or component. The application of
								the maintenance tasks to the end item
or component shall be consistent 								with
the capacities and capabilities of the designated
maintenance 								levels/classes, which
are shown in the MAC in column (4). Column
(4) 								is divided into two secondary
columns. These columns indicate the 								maintenance
levels/classes of "Field" and "Sustainment".
Each maintenance 								level column is further
divided into two sub-columns. These sub-columns
								identify the maintenance classes and
are as follows:  							</para>
<para> 								The maintenance to be performed
at field and sustainment 								levels is
described as follows:  						 								<seqlist>
<item> 										Field level maintenance classes:
 								 										<seqlist>
<item> Crew (operator) maintenance. This is
the responsibility of 												a using
organization to perform maintenance on its
assigned equipment. 												It normally
consists of inspecting, servicing, lubricating,
adjusting, 												and replacing parts,
minor assemblies, and subassemblies. Items
with 												a "C" ("O" for joint service
reporting) in the third position of the 												Source,
Maintenance, and Recoverability (SMR) code
may be replaced 												at the crew(operator)
class. A code of "C" ("O" for joint service)
												in the fourth position of the
SMR code indicates complete repair is 												authorized
at the crew (operator) class.  											</item>
<item> Maintainer maintenance. This is maintenance
accomplished on 												a component, accessory,
assembly, subassembly, plug-in unit, or other
												portion by field level units.
This maintenance is performed either 												on
the system or after it is removed. An "F"
in the third position 												of the SMR
code indicates replacement of assemblies,
subassemblies, 												or other components
is authorized at this level. An "F" in the
fourth 												position of the SMR code
indicates complete repair of the identified
												item is allowed at the Maintainer
class. Items repaired at this level 												are
normally returned to the user after maintenance
is performed.  											</item></seqlist
> 									</item>
<item> 										Sustainment level maintenance
classes:  								 										<seqlist>
<item> Below depot sustainment. This is maintenance
accomplished on 												a component, accessory,
assembly, subassembly, plug-in unit, or other
												portion either on the system or
after it is removed. The item subject 												to
maintenance has normally been forwarded to
a maintenance facility 												away from
the field level supporting units. An "H" in
the third position 												of the SMR
code indicates replacement of assemblies,
subassemblies, 												or other components
is authorized at this class. An "H" appearing
												in the fourth position of the
SMR code indicates complete repair is 												possible
at this class. Items are normally returned
to the supply 												system after maintenance
is performed at this class.  											</item>
<item> Depot. This is maintenance accomplished
on a component, accessory, 												assembly,
subassembly, plug-in unit, or other portion
either on the 												system or after
it is removed. Assets to be repaired at this
class 												are normally returned to
an Army Depot or authorized contractor facility.
												The replace function for this
class of maintenance is indicated by 												the
letter "D" or "K" appearing in the third position
of the SMR code. 												A "D" or "K"
appearing in the fourth position of the SMR
code indicates 												complete repair
is possible at the depot sustainment maintenance
level. 												Items are returned to the
supply system after maintenance is performed
												at this class.  											</item>
</seqlist> 									</item></seqlist> 							</para>
<para> The tools and test equipment requirements
table (immediately 								following the MAC)
lists the tools and test equipment (both special
								tools and common tool sets) required
for each maintenance task as 								referenced
from the MAC.  							</para>
<para> The remarks table (immediately following
the tools and test 								equipment requirements)
contains supplemental instructions and explanatory
								notes for a particular maintenance
task.  							</para>
