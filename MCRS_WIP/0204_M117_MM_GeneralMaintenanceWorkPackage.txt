				</step1>
				<step1>
					<para>Before beginning a task, find out how much repair, modification, or replacement is needed to fix the equipment.  Sometimes the reason for equipment failure can be seen right away and complete tear down is not necessary.  Disassemble equipment only as far as necessary to repair or replace damaged parts.</para>

					<para>In some cases, a part may be damaged during removal.  If the part appears to be good, and other parts behind it are not defective, leave it in place and continue with the procedure.  Here are a few simple rules:</para>
				<step2>
					<para>Do not remove dowel pins or studs unless loose, bent, broken, or otherwise damaged.</para>
				</step2>
				<step2>
					<para>Do not remove bearings or bushings unless damaged. If you need to remove them to access parts behind, carefully pull out bearings and bushings.</para>

					<para>Loctite Adhesive. Loctite adhesive (item 12, WP 0085 00) provides a seal against leakage and a resistance to loosening when used in the assembly of threaded, slip-fitted, or press-fitted parts. Always use grade of Loctite adhesive specified and never use when other reat ining means are provided, such as lockwires, lockwashers, lockplates, and fasteners. DO NOT use Loctite adhesive on brass fittings, plugs, or items that need frequent servicing, or when operating temperature exceeds 300&deg;F (149&deg;C). Apply Loctite adhesive as follows:</para>

				</step1>
			</proc>
			<proc>
				<title>TAGGING WIRES AND HOSES</title>
				<step1>
					<para>Use marker tags (item 15, WP 0085 00) to identify all electrical wires, lines, and any other parts which may be hard to identify or replace later. Fasten tags to parts during removal by wrapping wire fasteners around or through parts and twisting ends together. Position tags to be out of the way during cleaning, inspection, and repair. Mark tags with a pencil, pen, or marker.</para>
				</step1>
				<step1>
					<para>Whenever possible, identify electrical wires with the number of the terminal or wire to which it connects. If no markings can be found, tag both wires or wire and terminal, and use the same identifying mark for both. If you cannot tag a wire because it must fit through a small hole or you cannot reach it, write down the description of the wire and the point to which it connects or draw a simple diagram on paper. Be sure to write down enough information so you will be able to properly connect the wires during assembly. If you need to identify a loose wire, look for identifying numbers near the end of the wire, stamped on a permanent metal tag. Compare this number to wire number on the appropriate electrical schematic.</para>
				</step1>
				<step1>
					<para>Identify lines when you are taking off more than one line at the same time. Mark tags with points to which lines and hoses must be connected. If it is not obvious which end of a line goes where, at g each end of the line.</para>
				</step1>
				<step1>
					<para>Identify and tag other parts as required by name and installed location.</para>
