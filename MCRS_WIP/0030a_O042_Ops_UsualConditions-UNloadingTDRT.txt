							<trim.para>Winch cable can become frayed or contain broken wires. Wear heavy leather-palmed work gloves when handling Winch cable. Frayed or broken wire can injure hands.

A damaged winch cable, under load, could fail suddenly and strike personnel, and could cause the vehicle being recovered to shift suddenly creating a crush hazard. Failure to comply can result in injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>

							<trim.para>The following step assumes that the 35K FWTRD Winch was used for loading the TDRT, and that the winch cable and rigging was not removed for transport. If the 45K winch was used in loading the TDRT, it will be necessary to place the 45K winch cable through the FWTRD winching sheave and reattach it to the rigging on the disabled vehicle. Follow instructions in the prime mover TM for working with the 45K winch.
