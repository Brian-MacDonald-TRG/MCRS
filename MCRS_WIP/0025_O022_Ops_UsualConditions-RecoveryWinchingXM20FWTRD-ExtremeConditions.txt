				<title>Quick Evacuation Sledding</title>
				<step1>
					<specpara>
						<warning>
							<trim.para>Quick Evacuation Sledding is performed with the FWTRD boom extensions dragging on the ground, unsecured from the disabled vehicle. This could cause the load to shift side to side resulting in loss of control of the load and/or the prime mover. For this reason, speeds must be kept 10 mph or less during Quick Evacuation Sledding operations. Failure to comply can result injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>The Cross Bar for Sledding and Sledding Shoes are very heavy (Sledding Shoes 105 lbs./47.62 Kg each and the Cross Bar 270 lbs./122.47 Kg). The FWTRD should be used as much as possible in removing, positioning, and storing these items. Always use an assistant when it is necessary to physically handle the Cross Bar for Sledding and Sledding Shoes. Failure to comply can result in serious injury or death to personnel and or damage to equipment.</trim.para>
						</warning>
						<caution>
							<trim.para>Quick Evacuation Sledding should be performed for the shortest distance to bring a disabled vehicle to a safe and secured area. The disabled vehicle should then be properly configured for lift tow and/or loading onto the TDRT for transport. Failure to comply may result in damage to the equipment.</trim.para>

							<trim.para>The following step involves wrapping chains/straps around the STRYKER and the FWTRD boom extensions in one continuous loop. DO NOT attach the chains to individual boom extensions. If chained individually, the extensions would be pulled to the outside causing damage to the equipment, and possibly causing the load to shift suddenly creating a crush hazard that could result in death or injury to personnel.</trim.para>
