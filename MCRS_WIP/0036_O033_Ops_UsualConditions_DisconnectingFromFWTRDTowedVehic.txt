							<trim.para>All persons not involved in the loading or unloading operation must stand clear the full length of prime mover and towed load. A crush hazard exists.  Failure to comply may result in injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Due to the dimensions and center of gravity of some loads, Caution must be used when loading or unloading equipment to prevent shifting loads. Always use proper rigging as specified in FM 5-125 Rigging Techniques, Procedures, and Applications. Shifting loads can create a crush hazard that could cause injury or death to personnel and/or damage to equipment.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Visibility from the prime mover is significantly reduced when backing, whether the Fifth Wheel Towing and Recovery Device is loaded or not. If backing the FWTRD with its towed load is required, it should be done by two people, the first person in the prime mover cab and the second acting as a ground guide. The person in the prime mover cab must keep the ground guide in sight at all times. All other personnel should stand completely clear of the area. A crush hazard exists. Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Use extremely low speeds (5mph or less) when loading or unloading vehicles. Higher speeds will exaggerate motions and create hazardous conditions, which could result in personal injury or death or damage to equipment.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>Adding wheel chocks provides additional protection from the prime mover or towed load suddenly moving during disconnection. Failure to comply could result in a crush hazard causing injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
