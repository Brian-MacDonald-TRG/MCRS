The person in the prime mover cab must keep the ground guide in sight at all times. All other personnel should stand completely clear of the area. A crush hazard exists. Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>

							<trim.para>Refer to <extref docno="FM 5-125"/> "Rigging Techniques, Procedures, and Applications" for inspection of winch cables. A damaged winch cable, under load, could fail suddenly and strike personnel, and could cause the vehicle being recovered to shift suddenly creating a crush hazard. Failure to comply can result in injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
							<trim.para>While working with the heavy duty winches on the FWTRD, and loading a disabled vehicle onto the TDRT it may be necessary to climb on and walk on the equipment.
