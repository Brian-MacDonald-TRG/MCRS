							<trim.para>During uncoupling from the Tilt Deck Recovery Trailer, it may be necessary to adjust the angle of the FWTRD booms to match the angle of the TDRT mating cove.

							<trim.para>All other persons not involved in the actual coupling/uncoupling should stand clear of the prime mover to prevent serious injury or death.

							<trim.para>Uncoupling should be done by two people, the first person in the prime mover cab and the second acting as a ground guide. The person in the prime mover cab must keep the ground guide in sight at all times. All other personnel should stand completely clear of the area. A crush hazard exists. Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death to personnel.</trim.para>
